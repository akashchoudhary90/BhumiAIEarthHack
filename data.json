{"id":1,"problem":"Rapid advancement in technology and our demand for the latest electronic devices, such as laptops, computers, and other digital gadgets, result in huge amounts of electronic waste. It's not just harmful for the environment but also poses potential health risks due to the toxic materials contained in these gadgets.  ","solution":"We can contribute to the circular economy by developing a comprehensive online platform that connects people who want to lease their unused electronic devices with those in temporary need of such gadgets. This online marketplace would host a range of electronic devices, including computers, laptops, audio equipment, and other peripherals.   By doing so, we reduce the demand for new electronic goods, thus slowing down tech-related waste generation. As for financial impact, the website's leasing model could become a new revenue stream for electronic device owners and an affordable equipment source for consumers, businesses, and even schools and non-profits.   Features of this platform would include user accounts, device listings, transparent ratings and reviews, secure payment processing, lease agreement creation, and a seamless connection with shipping services. Implementation is highly feasible with current e-commerce technologies, and scalability is vast as digital gadgets are universally used and often replaced. The environmental impact is significant, as it directly targets the pressing issue of electronic waste and energy consumption."}
